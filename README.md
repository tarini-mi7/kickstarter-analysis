# Kickstarter Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
# Project
This is an analysis of the Kickstarter data to help Louise with crowdfunding campaigns, and finding out the factors that may help her have a successful campaign for her play "Fever". 
The Kickstarter data demonstrated that out of all the campaigns, the category "Theatre" outperformed all other categories. Out of 912 theater campaigns in US, 525 (58%) were successful while 349 (38%) were failures. There were also 12 campaigns that were active and 26 campaigns that were cancelled.

Theaters in the U.S. were further divided into the subcategories musicals, plays, and spaces. Out of these three subcategories, Plays contributed to theater the most, followed by spaces then musicals. Among 1047 play campaigns, 694 (66%) were successful, and 353 (33%) failed.

Knowing which season or month to launch a campaign may be key to success. This data shows that successful theater campaigns were launched during late Spring/early Summer (May-June), whereas failed campaigns were launched during the Winter (December).

A comparison between the successful and failed campaigns under the subcategory play in the US demonstrate that campaigns with a budget of more than $10,000 were ineffective for Louise. The average goal among successful kickstarters was about $5,000.

# Conclusions:

## Outcomes by launch date :
* Kickstarters launched in May/June have been more successful. So Louise should launch her play "Fever" sometime in late Spring or early Summer.
* Also, the campaign has not performed well in the winter. So Louise should avoid launching campaigns in the winter (October to December).

## Outcomes Based on Goals:
* Goals greater than $10,000 is not successful so Louise should focus on goals that are less than $10,000.

# Reasons for failure 
* One reason Louise’s play fell short of her goal could be due to when she launched her campaign. She may have launched her campaign in a month other than May or June given that Kickstarter data showed that successful campaigns were launched during these two months. There were 111 successful campaigns launched in May and 100 successful campaigns launched in June.
* Another reason could be due to length of her campaign. Some further analysis revealed that shorter Kickstarter are more successful. Campaign that are less than four weeks long (less than 30 days)  are more successful than campaigns that are four or more weeks long (more than 30 days). Among the 694 successful campaigns, 220 (31%) were less than a month and 303 (43%) were at least a month. Given that Louise’s play came close to its goal in a short amount of time, there may be another factor that may have led to her shortcomings. It is also important to define short time since there were several campaigns that were one week or two weeks long vs. three weeks or four weeks.

The dataset included several Kickstarters that were still alive during analysis. This may be a limitation since that data could not be used to determine success or failure. It would be interesting to obtain additional information on the average donation in relation to launch date, and whether timing could have affected how much a backer was able to donate. Perhaps a donor is more generous during tax season rather than Christmas season. Displaying this information using a line graph could help visualize time periods in which backers are most generous. Another suggestion would be to include average donation in relation to length of Perhaps this could uncover a factor to why Louise could not reach her goal.
